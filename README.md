Data preprocessing for the simulation study conducted in chapter 2 of my PhD Thesis.

The code corresponding to the simulaiton itself can be found here: https://github.com/RaspberryEmma/Confounder-Handling-Sim-Study.

This data processing depends on the python tool tably (https://github.com/narimiran/tably), credit to narimiran et al. (https://github.com/narimiran)
